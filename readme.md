## This project is to keep track of what Jetbrains will offer in terms of JVM based programming language


#### Tasks: 

1. As anyone expects the very first example is Hello world!. I adapted it a bit to include the name of the programming language - Kotlin. This is also good for memory, it will help me to store the name in my cortex.



#### Notes: 

1. I must admit that I am highly interested in Scala programming languages, but who knows, maybe because of the slowness of its compiler, some very hard to understand features and poor support in IDEs will make me switch to Kotlin (or maybe Google GO, even if it isn't JVM based).
1. On the other side I like the SCALA support for testing scalatest, scalacheck, specs2 and the easy of scalatra
